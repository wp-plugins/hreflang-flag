I needed some flag icons for a project i’m working on. I wanted the icons to follow ISO-3166 as not to miss any countries. I found a great resource on famfamfam.com

http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/flags/

247 such icons in GIF and PNG formats

Lining this up against current ISO-3166, I found a few missing, particularly:
Antartica (aq)
Saint Barthelemy (bl)
Guernsey (gg)
Isle of Man (im)
Jersey (je)
St. Martin (mf)

I made up these icons to match the existing set for these extra countries.
Feel free to use these (public domain) icons anywhere you’d like to round out your flag set. They’re the same dimensions as the original set. Attribution is appreciated, not required at all.

EXTRA FLAG: en.png

As I wanted language flags not country flags so I created en en.png based on a mix of gb and us. I mean I speak some variant of globish anyway...

This extra icon is also public domain, and as such is free for any use (attribution appreciated but not required).
